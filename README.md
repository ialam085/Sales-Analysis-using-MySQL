# ${\color{red} Sales\ Analysis\ using\ MySQL}$

## 📌 Objective
To explore and demonstrate SQL queries for real-world business scenarios and academic data analysis using SELECT, JOINS, WINDOW FUNCTIONS, AGGREGATIONS, and CTEs. This project focuses on generating meaningful insights from sales and student datasets relevant to BFSI and educational contexts.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
>- SQL (Tested on MySQL Workbench)

>- GitHub (Version control & code sharing)

>- Database: Sample schema from DA.Sales, Students, and Stud_info

## 📋 Steps Included
- Create and select databases and tables

- Perform basic and advanced SELECT queries

- Use of GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and LIMIT

- Window functions: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), NTILE()

- Apply CTE (Common Table Expression) for rank-based filtering

- Demonstrate various JOIN types using student and info tables

## 📊 Analysis Included
Highest and lowest total sales amounts by region and country

Average sales by shipping mode

Top-performing products and customers by total amount

Distinct region and country counts

Student performance analysis with ranking methods

Join operations to match student data with personal info

## 🔍 Key Insights
Certain countries and regions consistently generate higher revenue

Specific shipping modes yield higher average sales

Student ranking techniques help identify performance clusters

JOIN types provide powerful ways to combine related data

CTE helps in filtering ranked data like 3rd or 6th toppers easily

## ✅ Conclusion
This SQL project demonstrates the application of basic to advanced SQL features that are essential for data analysis in both business and academic use cases. The project reflects practical scenarios such as sales performance tracking, ranking analysis, and data joining techniques—skills highly useful in Data Analytics and BFSI roles.
